# FEMLab
## Introduction
FEMLab is a Matlab tool for numerical calculation of electromagnetic fields employing the finite element method. It is still under work so every now and then new functionalities and improvements will be added. The main purpose of this tool is the study of electromagnetic fields and the computation of these fields using the finite element method. To use it a Mesh file needs to be created with the gmesh software. Supported mesh file format is 2.2.0.8 .

## Capabilities

The current version is capable of handling :
- Electrostatic problems (planar and axissymmetric)
- Magnetostatic problems (planar and axissymmetric)

For every of the problem types the software will calculate :
- The vector potential A
- The Field vector
- The Energy
